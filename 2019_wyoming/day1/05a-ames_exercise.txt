mlr3 Exercises Day 1 - Ames Housing Dataset

This exercise is intended to use mlr3 to perform a benchmark analysis on the "Ames Housing Dataset".

The main objectives are as follows:

- To build machine learning models able to predict house price based on house features
- To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model

The dataset is part of a Kaggle InClass competition and available on https://bit.ly/2l0uWoz.
Kaggle is a platform which provides data science competitions and datasets which can be used to get familiar with typical machine learning methods.

Note: today, no preprocessing, feature engineering or parameter tuning is required. But: manual tuning (e.g. different parameters for a knn-learner) could improve the performance.

mlr3 Exercises Day 2 - Ames Housing Dataset

This exercise is intended to use mlr3tuning to improve the results of the benchmark analysis on the "Ames Housing Dataset" of day 1. There is a new Kaggle InClass competition for this day which is available on http://www.kaggle.com/c/ames-day2.


The main objective of this exercise is as follows:

- To apply an appropriate tuning technique to a learning algorithm in order to improve its predictive performance.
- This can be applied to any learning algorithm you learned about in the last two days.

Keep in mind that you are asked to use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) this time as a performance measure to evaluate the performance of a tuned algorithm for the Kaggle challenge.
